            <p><strong>Cook time: </strong>30-45 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Difficulty: </strong>Easy</p>
            <p><strong>Servings: </strong>4-6</p>
           
            <h3><u>Ingredients List</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Potatoes: About 2–2.5 lbs (1kg), peeled and cut into chunks</li>
                <li>Butter: 2–4 tbsp (25–50g), plus extra for greasing</li>
                <li>1/4–1 cup (60–250ml), as needed for mashing</li>
                <li>Egg: 1 large, beaten, for extra richness</li>
                <li>Seasoning: Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Onion: Optional, 1 chopped medium onion or 5–6 sliced spring onions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><u>Instructions</u></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Place the peeled and cut potatoes in a large pot with lightly salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Carefully drain the potatoes. Return them to the hot saucepan over very low heat for a minute to steam-dry them, which helps create fluffier mashed potatoes.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl. Add the butter and half of the milk, then mash until smooth or with your desired consistency. Add more milk if needed.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Stir in most of the grated cheese, the beaten egg (if using), and any other desired seasonings like chopped onions, spring onions, or mustard powder.</li>
                <li>Step 5: Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 20–45 minutes, depending on the crust style, until the topping is golden brown and the pie is heated through.</li>
            </ol>
